# üìù Unity Script Templates

This is a collection of some script templates you can use to help speed up the creation of new scripts. These templates are what I currently use.

## How to install
### Into project (Useful with source control)
1. Download the repository as a .zip
2. Drag the folder ScriptTemplates into the assets folder of your project you want it in
3. When you next open up the Unity editor, the templates would have loaded in. (If it's open already, close it and reopen it)
### Into Editor (Just for that editor version)
1. Download the repository as a .zip
2. Navigate to your editor's folder
3. Go to Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates\
4. Drag the .txt files inside the folder ScriptTemplates into that folder
4. When you next open up the Unity editor, the templates would have loaded in. (If it's open already, close it and reopen it)
